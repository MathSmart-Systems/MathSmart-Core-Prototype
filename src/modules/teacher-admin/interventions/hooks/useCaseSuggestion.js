/**
 * Asking for a support plan on one case, and asking again.
 *
 * Nothing here fires on its own. A suggestion exists only because a teacher
 * pressed a button, and it is produced entirely server-side — the browser
 * sends no evidence and receives no obligation to act on what comes back. The
 * reply is the whole case detail as it now stands, which the caller hands back
 * to the rest of the review so the deterministic fields and the advisory ones
 * stay one record rather than two.
 *
 * A failure never takes the stored plan away. The case is replaced only when
 * the server answers with a new one, so asking again and being refused leaves
 * the teacher reading the suggestion they already had — which is the whole
 * reason the failure is reported upward as a message rather than rendered in
 * the place the plan occupies.
 *
 * @param {string|null|undefined} interventionId - The open case
 * @param {(detail: object) => void} [onUpdated] - Receives the refreshed case
 * @param {{caseClosed?: boolean, onFailure?: (message: string) => void}} [context]
 * @returns {{generate: () => Promise<void>, generating: boolean, busy: boolean}}
