"""One error envelope for the whole API.

The contract fixes the shape:

    {"error": {"code": ..., "message": ..., "fields": {...}, "request_id": ...}}

with `fields` omitted unless the failure is field-specific. It also fixes what
must never appear in a user-facing message: an answer key, internal SQL, a
provider secret, or a record outside the caller's scope. An unexpected exception
is therefore never rendered — it is logged against the request id and replaced
with a fixed sentence.
