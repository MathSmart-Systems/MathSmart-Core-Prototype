"""Intervention routes.

The queue and every mutation belong to a Teacher/Administrator. Recording,
updating and archiving are security-critical decisions about a learner, so they
also require a live session: a signed-out token should not be able to change
what happens to somebody's case.

The model identifier is deployment configuration. It is stored on the case as
provenance, because the data model asks for it, and it is deliberately absent
from every response: a browser has no use for it, and `.env` values are not
printed anywhere.

Advisory text is never accepted from a request. A teacher may ask for a
suggestion, and the evidence that leaves the building is assembled here from
the case's own deterministic record; the answer is written to the case's
advisory columns without ever passing through a browser. Storing a suggestion
changes nothing about severity, status, type or the educator's own notes, so a
case reads the same with Gemini switched off as with it switched on.
