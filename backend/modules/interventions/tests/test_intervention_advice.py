"""Advisory support attached to one intervention case.

The rules being checked here are the boundary ones. A suggestion is only ever
produced when a teacher asks for it; the evidence that leaves the process is
assembled from the case's own record and carries no learner identity; the text
is written by the server and never accepted from a request; and every way Gemini
can fail — switched off at the server, switched off in the database, silent,
slow, or answering in a shape we did not expect — leaves the case untouched and
the deterministic workflow usable.

The database side of that promise, that storing advice changes no
deterministic field, is proved against PostgreSQL in
`supabase/tests/560_intervention_advice_test.sql`.
