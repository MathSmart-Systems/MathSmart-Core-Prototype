"""The advisory boundary, shared by every feature that may ask Gemini something.

The `/ai/*` routes were the only caller for a long time, so the gate, the
adapter lookup and the provenance block lived inside the router as private
helpers. A second caller has now arrived: the interventions module needs the
same advice, generated the same way, but written onto a case rather than
returned to a browser.

Copying those helpers into that module would have produced a second definition
of "is Gemini allowed to answer right now", and the first one to drift would have
been the one nobody noticed. So the boundary moved here instead, and both
callers use it. Nothing in this module talks to a browser: it takes a request
(for the adapter and the flags on `app.state`), a purpose, and evidence, and it
either returns an `AdvisoryResult` or raises the one documented 503.

The credential and the model are `.env` values read by the adapter. Nothing
here accepts either from a caller, and nothing returns more than the model name
the documented provenance block asks for.
