"""Request and response contracts for the advisory Gemini routes.

Every request model forbids extra fields, which is how a request that tries to
name a model or carry a credential is rejected rather than ignored. The model
and the API key are deployment configuration read from the server environment;
there is nowhere in these shapes to put either.

Every response carries provenance — provider, model, generated_at — because
advisory text without provenance is indistinguishable from an authored fact.
