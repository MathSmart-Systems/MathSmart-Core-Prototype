"""The advisory teaching note: what we ask for, and what we accept back.

The Students workspace shows one short note about a learner's weakest
competency. Asked an open question, the model answered with several hundred
words of Markdown — headings, bold, tables, a closing pep talk — and the page
printed it verbatim. A teacher reading a record needs four things and no more:
what the gap is, what in the record shows it, what to try, and how to tell it
worked.

So the note has that shape and nothing else. We ask for a small JSON object and
then enforce every limit here, because a prompt is a request and not a
guarantee:

- a learning gap of at most two short sentences;
- at most two pieces of evidence, each quoting numbers the request actually
  carried — a figure the model invented is dropped, and when nothing honest
  survives the evidence is written from the recorded numbers instead;
- at most three practical actions;
- one next check;
- no more than 150 words in all, with no markup, no links, no repeated
  conclusion and no motivational filler.

Nothing here decides anything. The note is a suggestion a teacher reads.
