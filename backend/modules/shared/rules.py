"""Deterministic scoring, banding and progression rules.

This module is the application-side half of a pair. The database enforces the
same two derivations as CHECK constraints through `app.percentage_for` and
`app.mastery_band_for`, so a row whose stored percentage or band disagrees with
its own evidence cannot be written even if this module were wrong. Keeping both
halves is deliberate: the backend needs to compute a value before it writes it,
and the database needs to refuse a value it did not compute.

Nothing here calls Gemini, imports an AI client, or takes an advisory input.
Correct or incorrect, raw and percentage scores, attempt counts, bands, unlock
rules and intervention triggers are decided here and nowhere else.
