"""The server-side Gemini adapter.

Gemini is advisory. It never decides correctness, a score, a mastery band, an
unlock, an intervention trigger, a role or a permission, and no caller here may
treat its output as authoritative.

The whole surface is therefore one method that returns advice **or nothing**.
Disabled by feature flag, timed out, rate limited, refused, or answering with a
shape we did not expect all produce the same result: `None`, and the caller
falls back to authored deterministic content. Nothing in this module raises into
a request path, so no grade or progress transaction can roll back because Gemini
failed.

The credential is read once through `SecretStr.get_secret_value()` when a
request is built, is sent only in the `x-goog-api-key` header, and is never logged,
returned, or included in a prompt. The selected model is deployment
configuration and cannot be supplied by an API request.
