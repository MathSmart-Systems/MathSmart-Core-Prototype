"""Assessment routes.

Reading is ordinary. Sitting, answering and submitting are learner actions that
run through database functions, because the tables involved are SELECT-only for
the caller and grading has to read a column the caller cannot. Authorising a
reassessment is an educator decision, so it additionally requires a live
session: it changes what a learner is allowed to do, and a signed-out token
should not be able to do that.
