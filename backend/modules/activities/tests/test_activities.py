"""Activity routes.

An activity gives feedback while the learner is still working, so the two
things worth guarding are what comes back and who may ask. The verdict, the
authored explanation and the hint all come from database functions that read
columns the API connection cannot select; the answer key is never among them.

The arithmetic, the pass decision and the intervention trigger are proved
against PostgreSQL in
`supabase/tests/540_activity_attempt_functions_test.sql`.

The advisory hint wording is proved here with a stand-in adapter. Nothing in
this file reaches Gemini: a live advisory request would be a paid call, and what
is worth proving is what a learner gets when that call is off, silent or
broken, which no live call can demonstrate on demand.
