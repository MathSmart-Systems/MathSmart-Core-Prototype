"""Activity routes.

Everything a learner does here goes through a database function, for the same
two reasons throughout: the columns that decide correctness are ones the API
connection cannot read, and the learner's own records are SELECT-only for them.

`ai_feedback` and `ai_hint` are the only advisory fields in the module. They are
null unless Gemini answered, and no score, band, pass decision or intervention
depends on them. `ai_hint` is wording placed beside the authored hint, never
instead of it, so a learner whose Gemini call is off, slow or refused reads
exactly the hint their teacher wrote.
