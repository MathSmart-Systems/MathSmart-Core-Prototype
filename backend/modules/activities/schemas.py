"""Request and response contracts for the activities module.

As in the assessments module, the shapes here cannot express an answer key, a
correct answer, or a learner other than the caller. `ai_feedback` is present and
optional because the route contract has a place for advisory phrasing; nothing
depends on it, and it is null whenever Gemini is off or silent.
