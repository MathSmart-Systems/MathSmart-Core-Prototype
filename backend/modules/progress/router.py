"""Progress routes.

`/progress/me` and `/progress/{student_id}` build the same answer from the same
statements. Who may ask about whom is decided here and again by the policies:
a learner may name only themselves, and `security_invoker` on the reporting view
means that even if this check were wrong, the view would still resolve to their
own row.

Growth is `current - diagnostic`. The recommended next action is the first
available item of the learner's own path. Neither consults Gemini.

The counts a learner is shown are pairs, and each pair is drawn from one set:
mastery is counted against the competencies published for their grade, and
module completion against the modules their own path assigns. The mastered
figure stays the database's — `app.mastery_band_for` decides a band, and this
module only reports how many rows it landed on.
