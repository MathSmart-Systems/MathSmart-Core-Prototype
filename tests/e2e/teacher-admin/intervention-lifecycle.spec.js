/**
 * The Teacher Interventions workflow, end to end, against a real case.
 *
 * Its sibling `interventions.spec.js` is deliberately read-only: it asserts
 * which moves the interface offers and skips whenever the live queue has
 * nothing in the state it needs. That leaves the parts that matter most
 * unproved — recording an action, who it is attributed to, and what happens
 * when a teacher asks a language model for help — because nothing in a
 * read-only suite can put a case into the state those need.
 *
 * So this one creates its own case, through the same authenticated API a
 * teacher uses, and runs only against the local Supabase stack. It never
 * writes to a hosted project: a case is a record about a real child, and a
 * test suite has no business leaving one behind.
