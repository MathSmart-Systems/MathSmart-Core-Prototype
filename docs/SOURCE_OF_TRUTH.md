## 1. System Identity & Purpose

**MathSmart** is an AI-powered, web-based interactive learning system built to enhance Mathematics skills among elementary learners. The system follows a **Diagnose → Target → Practice → Monitor → Reassess** cycle, powered by the **ARAL (Assist, Remediate, Accelerate, Learn)** framework and aligned with DepEd Grade 6 Mathematics competencies.

### Learning Cycle

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  DIAGNOSE   │ ──▸ │   TARGET    │ ──▸ │  PRACTICE   │ ──▸ │   MONITOR   │
│             │     │             │     │             │     │             │
│ Diagnostic  │     │ ARAL-Based  │     │ Interactive │     │ Progress &  │
│ Assessment  │     │ Modules     │     │ Activities  │     │ Teacher/Admin│
│             │     │             │     │             │     │ Dashboards  │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

Monitoring leads to reassessment when a learner is ready to verify growth or when a Teacher/Administrator authorizes a new diagnostic cycle. Reassessment then recalculates competency results and the targeted learning path.

### Target Audience

| User | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Students** | Take assessments, follow a targeted learning path, complete activities, and track their own progress |
| **Teacher/Administrators** | Monitor learners, manage interventions, administer users and curriculum content, maintain grades/sections, run reports, and configure the system |

---

## 2. Core Features

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Student Profiling** | Records learner identity, enrollment, learning status, and permitted preferences for individualized monitoring |
| 2 | **Mathematics Diagnostic Assessment** | Uses deterministic scoring to identify competency strengths/gaps and produce an ordered learning path |
| 3 | **ARAL-Based Learning Modules** | Provides targeted objectives, concepts, rules, visuals, worked examples, takeaways, and linked practice |
| 4 | **Interactive Mathematics Activities** | Provides deterministic answer checking, immediate feedback, optional hints/explanations, retries, and completion summaries |
| 5 | **Progress Monitoring Dashboard** | Tracks diagnostic baseline, current mastery, growth, modules, activities, assessment history, and recommended next action |
| 6 | **Teacher/Administrator Intervention Dashboard** | Provides class and learner evidence, priorities, Gemini-assisted insights, recorded actions, notes, and case status |

---

### Reference-Derived Experience Contract

The sibling `ui-ux-workflow-reference/` application is the approved functional and visual baseline for the working system. It communicates how the system should generally look, function, and flow. It is not production architecture and does not cap design quality.

#### What must be preserved

- The learner journey from authentication and diagnostic status to results, targeted learning, activity feedback, progress, and reassessment.
- Clear state distinctions for completed, current/in-progress, available/recommended, locked/upcoming, and needs-support work.
- A focused assessment experience with progress, question navigation, unanswered-item awareness, back/next controls, and submit confirmation.
- Structured modules containing a learning objective, explanation, rules or formulas, visual support where useful, worked examples, takeaways, and an associated activity.
- Deterministic activity feedback, retry behavior, completion summary, mastery change, and continue-learning action.
- Student-facing dashboard, assessment history, learning path, activity list, progress, and profile surfaces.
- A combined Teacher/Administrator workspace containing the dashboard, roster filtering, student drill-down, analytics, interventions, user management, competencies, learning modules, activities, question bank, assessments, grades/sections, reports, thresholds, integrations, and settings.

#### What may and should improve

- Visual hierarchy, typography, spacing, navigation clarity, layout density, interaction feedback, responsiveness, accessibility, perceived performance, and content wording.
- Loading, empty, error, offline/interrupted, validation, permission-denied, success, and recovery states that are incomplete in the prototype.
- Clear module boundaries inside the combined Teacher/Administrator workspace so teaching, content, reporting, and settings work can be developed independently.
- Secure server/client boundaries, route-based navigation, persistence, auditability, and API-backed state.

#### Prototype-only behavior that is not a production requirement

- Demo role switching and demo learner-persona selection.
- Hardcoded accounts, fixed dates, mock records, synthetic charts, generated CSV data, and simulated network or AI latency.
- Browser-resident grading answer keys or privileged configuration.
- A globally visible technical AI architecture banner; production may replace it with contextual help or a Teacher/Administrator-only status surface.
- Vite, TypeScript-only component structure, and `AppContext` as a single global data store. The working application remains a Next.js App Router project and follows its current JavaScript/JSX conventions until deliberately migrated.

#### Canonical production screen inventory

| Audience | Screens/surfaces |
|---|---|
| **Student** | Login/register, dashboard, assessments/history, diagnostic player, diagnostic results, My Learning, module viewer, activities, activity player, activity completion, progress, profile/preferences |
| **Teacher/Administrator** | Dashboard, students/roster, learner drill-down, interventions, assessments, competencies, learning modules, activities, question bank, grades/sections, reports/analytics, settings, account administration, Gemini feature flags, and audit views. Credentials and model selection remain server-side `.env` configuration |

#### Canonical status vocabulary

| Concept | Values/rules |
|---|---|
| **Diagnostic attempt** | `not_started`, `in_progress`, `completed` |
| **Content publication** | `draft`, `published`, `archived` |
| **Learning-path item** | `locked`, `available`, `in_progress`, `completed` |
| **Competency display band** | `Mastered` at 80–100; `Developing` at 50–79; `Needs Improvement` at 0–49 |
| **Activity pass** | Configurable; default 75%. Passing an activity does not automatically change the display band unless the resulting competency score reaches that band's threshold. |
| **Learner monitoring status** | `active`, `needs_intervention`, `improving`, `mastered`, `inactive` |
| **Intervention severity** | `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW` |
| **Intervention lifecycle** | `Needs Intervention`, `In Progress`, `Resolved` |
| **Default automatic intervention trigger** | Two unsuccessful activity attempts for the same competency; Teacher/Administrator-configurable from 1–5 with changes audited |

The MVP supports `multiple_choice`, `number_input`, and `fill_blank` questions. The data contract may reserve `true_false`, `matching`, and `ordering` for later activation after accessible interaction and grading support are complete.

## 4. Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js (React) + Tailwind CSS | SSR support, file-based routing, fast DX, production-ready |
| **Backend API** | FastAPI (Python) | Math logic stays in Python; async, fast, auto-generates Swagger API docs |
| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Managed PostgreSQL + built-in auth + file storage + real-time in one platform |
| **Authentication** | Supabase Auth | Managed identities and sessions; application metadata and policies enforce `student` and `teacher_admin` roles |
| **Deterministic Math Engine** | Python (NumPy, SymPy, scikit-learn, Pandas as justified) | Objective grading, scoring, gap rules, mastery evaluation, and analytics |
| **Generative AI** | Gemini through a server-side adapter; API credential and selected model come from `.env` | Misconception summaries, learner-friendly feedback, and advisory teacher recommendations |
| **Frontend Hosting** | Vercel | Managed Next.js deployment with Git-based CI/CD; confirm the current plan and limits before launch |
| **Backend Hosting** | Railway / Render | Both support Python deployments; final choice depends on operational requirements and current plans |
| **Media Assets** | Cloudinary or Supabase Storage | Images and diagrams for modules; choose based on access control, delivery, and current pricing |
| **Dashboard Charts** | Chart.js / Recharts | Progress visualization in Student and Teacher/Administrator dashboards |

### Python AI / Math Libraries

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **FastAPI** | Exposes Python math logic as REST API endpoints |
| **NumPy** | Numerical computation and array operations |
| **SymPy** | Symbolic math, equation solving and simplification |
| **scikit-learn** | Scoring models, gap analysis, simple ML classification |
| **Pandas** | Data processing for assessment results and analytics |
| **Gemini SDK behind adapter** | Bounded explanations and pedagogical suggestions without coupling deterministic domain rules to the AI client |

### Deterministic and Gemini AI Boundary

| Deterministic application responsibility | Gemini AI responsibility |
|---|---|
| Correct/incorrect evaluation | Rephrase feedback in supportive learner-appropriate language |
| Raw and percentage scores | Explain likely misconceptions using submitted evidence |
| Attempt counts and time-on-task | Summarize incorrect-answer patterns |
| Competency bands and progress trajectories | Suggest possible remediation strategies to a teacher |
| Module/activity unlock rules | Recommend scaffolding language or visual metaphors |
| Intervention trigger and severity rules | Draft an advisory teacher insight |
| Authorization and role decisions | No role or authorization decision |

Gemini output is advisory, labeled, and non-authoritative. It must be invoked server-side, receive the minimum required learner context, exclude secrets and unnecessary personally identifiable information, use timeouts/rate limits, and fall back gracefully to deterministic content. Gemini failure must not prevent grading, progress updates, or intervention recording. The API credential and model selection are deployment-only values loaded from the working application's existing `.env`; they are not stored in `SYSTEM_SETTING`, accepted from API requests, or editable in Student or Teacher/Administrator UI.

### Supabase Security Baseline

- Supabase Auth owns credentials and issues access tokens; application profile tables do not store password hashes.
- FastAPI verifies the token signature, issuer, expiry, and subject, then applies application authorization. Prefer asymmetric signing keys and the project's JWKS discovery endpoint.
- Store role/authorization claims in trusted `app_metadata` or authoritative database relationships, never user-editable `user_metadata`. Refresh sessions when authorization changes must take effect immediately.
- Never expose secret/service-role keys in browser code or `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables. Browser code uses only the project URL and publishable key.
- Explicitly grant access to intended Data API objects and enable Row Level Security on every table/view in an exposed schema. Authentication alone is insufficient: policies must enforce Student ownership or the `teacher_admin` role.
- If all application data flows through FastAPI, prefer disabling direct Data API access or exposing a minimal dedicated API schema. Treat RLS as defense in depth rather than replacing FastAPI authorization.
- Exposed views use security-invoker behavior where supported. Privileged functions are kept out of exposed schemas, receive narrow execute grants, and avoid `SECURITY DEFINER` unless a reviewed use case requires it.

## 5. User Roles & Access Control

### Role Definitions

| Role | Access Level | Key Capabilities |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| 🎓 **Student** | Own learner workspace | Authenticate, manage permitted profile fields, take assessments, follow targeted modules, complete activities, and view own progress/history |
| 👩‍🏫 **Teacher/Administrator** (`teacher_admin`) | School-wide teaching and administration workspace | View learner evidence and analytics, manage students/interventions, administer users and Grade 6 curriculum content, maintain grades/sections, export reports, and configure thresholds/integrations/Gemini feature flags; deployment controls credentials/model through `.env` |

Production has exactly two authorization claims: `student` and `teacher_admin`. The reference prototype's `TEACHER_ADMIN` concept maps to the canonical lowercase `teacher_admin` claim. FastAPI authorization and Supabase policies enforce the distinction between learners and Teacher/Administrators.

## 8. MVP Scope & Success Criteria

> The **Minimum Viable Product** is the smallest working version of MathSmart that delivers real value to learners and Teacher/Administrators without over-engineering.

---

### ✅ MVP Scope — Included

| # | Feature | MVP Details |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Identity and profiles** | Real authentication, role guards, learner identity/enrollment, login/logout, and permitted profile updates |
| 2 | **Diagnostic and results** | Fixed 30–40 item assessment, autosave, deterministic grading, competency results, history, gap report, and targeted path |
| 3 | **ARAL learning path** | At least 3–5 remediation modules per covered gap area with objectives, explanations, rules, examples, visuals, completion, and linked activities |
| 4 | **Interactive activities** | Multiple-choice, numeric-input, and fill-blank questions with deterministic feedback, hints, retries, timing, scoring, and completion summary |
| 5 | **Student workspace** | Dashboard, My Learning, activities, assessments/history, progress, and profile surfaces backed by persisted data |
| 6 | **Teacher/Administrator workspace** | Dashboard, roster filters, learner drill-down, heatmap/analytics, at-risk detection, intervention lifecycle, and administrative navigation |
| 7 | **Curriculum and school administration** | Minimum viable management for competencies, learning modules, activities, question bank, assessments, grades/sections, settings, and enrollment |
| 8 | **Reporting and quality** | Safe CSV export, responsive layouts, keyboard-accessible core flows, and explicit loading/empty/error states |

---

### ❌ MVP Scope — Excluded (Post-MVP)

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Adaptive question difficulty (real-time AI) | Requires ML model training; deferred to v2 |
| Persistent gamification economy (XP, badges, streaks, leaderboards) | Prototype badges are examples; durable gamification is not core to learning effectiveness |
| Video-based module content | Infrastructure cost; use text/image first |
| Parent portal | Out of primary user scope for MVP |
| Offline mode / PWA | Adds complexity; assume internet access |
| Report export (PDF) | Nice-to-have; deferred to v1.1 |
| Open-ended AI chatbot | Bounded, feature-flagged explanations and insights may be used; unrestricted chat is post-MVP |
| Multi-subject expansion | MathSmart is Math-only in MVP |

---

### MVP Success Criteria

- [ ] A student can register, take a diagnostic, and receive a personalized module path
- [ ] A student can complete at least one ARAL module and its activity
- [ ] A Teacher/Administrator can log in, view learner performance, and identify at-risk learners
- [ ] A Teacher/Administrator can record an intervention type and notes, then advance the case status
- [ ] A Teacher/Administrator can publish the minimum content needed for the diagnostic-to-activity journey
- [ ] Assessment results are stored and reflected in both Student and Teacher/Administrator dashboards
- [ ] Scores, mastery, unlocks, and interventions remain correct when Gemini is disabled by feature policy or temporarily unavailable
- [ ] Core flows work on desktop and mobile and are keyboard operable with explicit non-color status labels

## 11. Folder Structure (Target)

> **Based on:** [nghiemledo/nextjs-project-structure](https://github.com/nghiemledo/nextjs-project-structure)

This is the approved module-first architecture. Its route, frontend-module, backend-module, and test boundaries were scaffolded on September 8, 2026. Next.js route files stay thin; feature UI, state, services, schemas, and unit tests live in independently owned modules. Most feature directories currently contain tracked placeholders rather than implementations. Existing code and configuration remain authoritative for what currently runs.

```

Each frontend feature directory owns `components/`, `hooks/`, `services/`, `schemas/`, `utils/`, `__tests__/`, and `index.js` when those concerns are needed. Each backend business directory owns `router.py`, `schemas.py`, `service.py`, `repository.py`, and `tests/`. Empty folders are not created speculatively. A module exposes its supported surface through its `index.js` or router/service contract; other modules must not deep-import its private files.
