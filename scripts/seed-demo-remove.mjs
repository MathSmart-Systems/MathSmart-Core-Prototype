/**
 * `npm run seed:demo:remove` — takes away exactly what `npm run seed:demo`
 * made, and nothing else.
 *
 * Every demo record carries the `DEMO` mark in its code or its title, and this
 * removes only records carrying it. A competency, module, question or paper a
 * real teacher authored has no mark and is never looked at twice.
 *
 * Order matters and is not negotiable. The learner is purged first, because
 * their attempts and path items reference the content; then the papers and
 * practice that reference the questions; then the questions; then the modules;
 * then the competencies everything else hangs off. A delete out of order is
 * refused by the database rather than cascading, which is the behaviour we
 * want — but doing it in the right order means it never has to refuse.
